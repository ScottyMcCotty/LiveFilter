## Documentation of my journey :)

The `many_filters.py` script worked! I saw myself in the original camera and then 6 copies of myself with various built-in filters:

<img src="script-capture-1.png" alt="original image with six filtered copies" width="800"/>

However, it seems like the original video and each of the six filtered copies are mirrored from how I want them.

The video feed is from the point of view of the camera, but I'd rather it look more like a mirror image of myself. I bet OpenCV has a built-in mirroring function...
